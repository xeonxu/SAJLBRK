# Topanga for iOS 11 (up to 11.1.2)

What it achieves so far:

* tfp0 (thanks to @i4nbeer)
* bootstrap + Cydia 64-bit
* AMFI codesigning stuff (thanks to @xerub)

---
### Notes:
there are two methods currently used to grab hashes for amfi. xerub's and another method that supports FAT binaries (yes, Cydia is FAT).

---

### Todo:

* fix ui caching issues
* add `jailbreakd` daemon
* fix issues w/ AMFI
